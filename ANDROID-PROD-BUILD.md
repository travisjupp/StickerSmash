# Create a production build for Android


Create a production build for Android Learn about the process of creating a
production build for Android and automating the release process.

In this chapter, we'll create our example app's production version and submit
it to the Google Play Store. We'll also explore how to automate the creation
and release of new app versions.

## Prerequisites 

To publish and distribute an app on the Google Play Store, we need:

* Google Play Developer Account: Must have a paid developer account. For
details on setting one up, visit the Google Play sign-up page. 

* Google Service Account key: We'll need a Google Service Account email and
JSON key to automate the app submission process. Follow the detailed
instructions in our guide on creating a Google Service Account key or
downloading it from an existing account , then return to this guide. This is
optional but required for automating the release process. 

* Production build profile: Ensure that a production build profile is present
in your eas.json, which is added by default. 


## Production build for Android 

A production Android build has a .aab format which is optimized for
distribution on the Google Play Store. Unlike .apk builds, .aab files can only
be distributed and installed through the Google Play Store. 

### 1. Create a production build 

To create an Android production build using the default production profile,
open your terminal and execute the following command. Since production is set
as the default profile in the EAS configuration, there is no need to specify it
explicitly with the --profile flag.

        eas build --platform android 

The above command will queue the build. Notice in the Expo dashboard that the
Version Code is auto-incremented.

### 2. Create an app on the Google Play Console 

To upload the app to the Google Play Store for the first time, we need to:

* Go to the Google Play dashboard. 

* On the Home page, click Create app to make a new app. 

( Create app on Google Play Console ) 

* Fill out our app details and click the Create app button. 

( Create app form on Google Play Console )

### 3. Release an internal testing version

After the app is created on Google Play Console, it redirects us to the app's
Dashboard screen. We need to prepare an internal test version of our app.

* Click Start testing now on the Dashboard. 

( Steps under start testing now on Google Play Console ) 

* Create an email list of users under Internal Testing > Testers for the
internal testing release.

( Create an email list for internal testers ) 

* Google Play Console prompts us to create a Release. 

* To create a new release, go to Releases and click Create new release. 

( Selecting the signing key for the app bundle ) 

* To store the signing key, go to App integrity > App bundles and click Choose signing key > Use Google-generated key. 

( Creating a new internal release 4 ) 

### 4. Upload the app binary 

After EAS has created a production build:

* Open the EAS dashboard and click on Download to get the .aab file. 

( Downloading the aab file ) 

* Return to the Google Play Console and go to App bundles. Click on Upload to
add the .aab. 

* Provide the release details for our app and click on Next. 

* On the following screen, click on Save and publish. 

( Uploading aab file to Google Play Console 5 )

### 5. Share the internal release version 

Under Track Summary, we see that the latest release shows a temporary app name.
This is because our app is not reviewed yet.

( App pending review on Google Play Console ) 

Under Releases, we see that the app is available to internal testers. To
share the app with a team of testers:

* Open the Internal testing dashboard, then click on View release details. 

* Click on copy link under How testers join your test. 

( Sharing the internal release version ) 

* On the device, open the test email and follow the steps to download the app. 

( Downloading app on the device as an internal tester )

* The testing email holder needs to accept the invite, and once accepted, the
app can be installed on the device. 

( On accepting the invite, the app can be installed on the device
App installed on the device as an internal tester )

Tip: To publish an app on the Play Store, in the Google Dashboard, finish the
steps under Set up your app. These steps are required before releasing the app
on the Play Store for the first time. You'll have to provide details like a
link to a privacy policy, a target audience, data safety and so on.

app store assets on how to create screenshots and previews.


### 6. Add Google Service Account permissions key 

Tip: Before following the steps in this section, see the instructions on
creating a Google Service Account key or downloading it from an existing
account guide. 

From now on, we can use EAS Submit to automate releases and avoid the manual
process. To do that, we need to add the service account key to our project's
eas.json.

After following the Google Service Account guide steps, we can use the
downloaded JSON key:

* Open our project and copy the JSON file from the Google Service Account to
the project's root directory. 

* To secure sensitive data, ensure this file is excluded from version control
by listing it in our .gitignore

### 7. Internal release

Let's add the path to the Google Service Account file path in eas.json.

* Under submit.production profile, add android.serviceAccountKeyPath and the
relative file path as its value:

```json
{
  ... 
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "./service-account-file.json",
        "track": "internal"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the above snippet, we're also adding track property and setting its value to
internal. This will enable the eas submit command to upload our production
build and release it for internal testing on the Google Play Store.

* Now run the eas submit command to release a new internal testing version:

        eas submit --platform android 

* This command will automatically create a new internal release version in
Google Play Console: 

( Automatic internal release version created in Google Play Console by EAS
Submit ) 

### 8. Production release 

To release the app for production:

* Change the value for track to production in eas.json:

```json
{
  ... 
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "./service-account-file.json",
        "track": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* We can also use the same EAS Build we did for the internal testing release.
Run the eas submit command to release to the Play Store:

        eas submit --platform android 


* To create a track and submit our app to the Google Play Store's review
process, we need to Release > Production and under Releases, select the build
we want to send for review. 

( Submitting app for Google Play Store review process ) 

### 9. Automated release 

For subsequent releases in future, we can streamline the process by combining
build creation and Play Store submission into a single step by using the
--auto-submit flag with eas build:

        eas build --platform android --auto-submit
